## 💻 Programming Journey

My path in tech started early and quickly became professional.

I worked for **3 years** as a **Junior Full-Stack Developer**, contributing to real-world projects, supporting ongoing systems, and taking responsibility for maintaining and evolving features across the stack.

During this time, I:

- Assisted in the development and maintenance of production systems
- Collaborated with senior developers and cross-functional teams
- Helped manage and implement features in active projects
- Gained hands-on experience with real business rules and client needs
- Developed a strong focus on **security, scalability, and clean code practices**

I’m always aiming to build systems that are not only functional, but also:

- 🔐 **Secure** — thinking about vulnerabilities and safe development practices  
- 📈 **Scalable** — designing solutions that can grow with user and business needs  
- 🧼 **Maintainable** — writing clean, readable, and well-structured code  

Beyond technical skills, I strongly value:

- 🤝 **Clear communication**
- 👥 **Teamwork and collaboration**
- 📌 **Responsibility and ownership of tasks**

These experiences helped shape not only my technical foundation but also my professional mindset as a developer.
