## 💻 Programming Journey

My journey in tech quickly became professional.

I worked for **3 years** as a **Junior Full-Stack Developer**, contributing to real-world systems, maintaining production applications, and helping implement and manage features across the stack. This gave me hands-on experience with real business rules, hierarchy, client needs, and team-based development.

During this time, I developed a strong focus on building software that is:

- 🔐 **Secure** — applying safe development practices  
- 📈 **Scalable** — designing systems that grow with demand  
- 🧼 **Maintainable** — writing clean, readable, well-structured code  

Beyond technical skills, I highly value:

- 🤝 **Clear communication**
- 👥 **Teamwork and collaboration**
- 📌 **Responsibility and ownership**

These experiences shaped both my technical foundation and my professional mindset as a developer.
